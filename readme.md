## What is this HUD?
This HUD is a modified version of the default HUD to make things much easier to see and understand what's going on at any given moment.

## What about your other HUD, "SimplyHUD"?
Yes, both HUDs are similar in use, however this HUD is supposed to be the successor to "SimplyHUD". I will still however make both HUDs the same but have "SimplyHUD" be done in the style of TF2 while this HUD is supposed to be a redesign of TF2's default HUD.

## What about a crosshair on my hud?
I'm working on creating a system to add your own crosshairs, but for now you can use the `CustomCrosshairImage` element under `extras.res` for a custom hud crosshair as well as a custom hitmarker.

## What are the 10 buttons on the main menu for?
These are shortcuts you can map yourself using the alias `bookmark_nn` where `nn` is the number. For example: `alias bookmark_01 "echo I'm a button!"` and `alias bookmark_02 "echo I'm also a button!"`.
Eventually I will create a way for you to add your own aliases, but for now just add your aliases to your `autoexec` or elsewhere. Just remember to set the aliases at some point for the buttons to work.

## Something's out of place," "something's overlapping something else," "this looks weird," etc.
This HUD is still in development, it's in a similar stage to "SimplyHUD" where it's not perfect, and some things don't quite look right. Just send an issue on this repository and I'll get to it eventually.

## What about my own HUD crosshairs?
I'll eventually add a program to create and set your own HUD crosshairs so you don't have to do them manually, for now, just do what you'd do normally.
