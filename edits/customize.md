# What is what:
- `disabled`: All files in this folder are disabled (ignored) and nothing in this folder will be used in the HUD.
- `enabled`: All files in this folder are enabled and they modify the game's HUD accordingly.

# How do customize:
Simply move a `.res` file from "disabled" folder and put it in "enabled." That's it. You're done.

# How do I know what file does what?
Open the file in a text editor of some kind, and read the top of the file, it always has an explanation as to what the file is for and what it does.
